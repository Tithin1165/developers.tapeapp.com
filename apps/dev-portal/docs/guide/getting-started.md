If you're new to the Tape API and want to build cool stuff, you've come to the right place. In this guide you'll learn how to use the Tape API by interacting with a record.

## Authentication

The easiest way to authenticate with the Developer API is to use your personal user API key. User API keys have the prefix `user_key_`. If you are not already a Tape user, the first step is to sign up and create an account [here](https://tapeapp.com/signup).

> Note that your API key carries the same privileges as your user account, so be sure to keep it secret! However, if your API key gets leaked, you can always deactivate it and generate a new one inside your user settings.

## The Basics

The world runs on JSON over HTTP (or HTTPS hopefully). The Tape API is no exception, so if you know how to send and receive JSON data via HTTPS, you are all set.
The API is RESTful for the most part, meaning that you can use the HTTP verbs `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` to interact with resources like records, apps and workspaces.

The base URL to send all API requests is `https://api.tapeapp.com`. Now, with the boring stuff out of the way, let's have some fun, shall we? ðŸ¥‚

## Retrieve your first Record

Records are the place where work gets done inside every Tape organization. The endpoint for retrieving a record is `/v1/records/{record_id}`. Let's get started by retrieving a record from your Tape organization:

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">
<ApiKeyCodeblock language="shell" title='Get your record "#RECORD_TITLE"'>
{`curl #BASE_URL/v1/record/#RECORD_ID  \\
  -u #USER_API_KEY:
`}
</ApiKeyCodeblock>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="js" label="Node.js">
<ApiKeyCodeblock language="javascript" title='Get your record "#RECORD_TITLE"'>
{`let req = http.get(
  "#BASE_URL/v1/record/#RECORD_ID",
  {
    method: "get",
    headers: {
      Authorization: "Bearer #USER_API_KEY",
    },
  },
  (res) => {
    res.on("data", (data) => {
      console.log(JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(data.toString()), null, 2));
    });
  }
);`}
</ApiKeyCodeblock>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="php" label="PHP">
<ApiKeyCodeblock language="php" title='Get your record "#RECORD_TITLE"'>
{`<?php
$opts = array(
  'http'=>array(
    'method'=>"GET",
    'header'=>"Authorization: Bearer #USER_API_KEY"
  )
);
\n
$context = stream_context_create($opts);
$data = file_get_contents('#BASE_URL/v1/record/20', false, $context);
$responseContent = json_decode($data, true);
echo json_encode($responseContent, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);
?>`}
</ApiKeyCodeblock>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">
<ApiKeyCodeblock language="python" title='Get your record "#RECORD_TITLE"'>
{`curl #BASE_URL/v1/record/#RECORD_ID  \\
  -u #USER_API_KEY:
`}
</ApiKeyCodeblock>
</TabItem>

</Tabs>
