The Tape API is versioned. A new API version is released when we introduce a **backwards-incompatible** change to the API. For example, changing a property's name. The current version is `v1`.

:::info Versioning is only for backwards incompatible changes
For new features and additions to the API, such as adding a new API endpoint, or including a new property in an existing API endpoint's response, there won't be a new version. You'll be able to take advantage of any new functionality on the version of the API you're currently using.
