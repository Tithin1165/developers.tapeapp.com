HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) describes how elements should be rendered on screen or on other media.
The Tape calculation field supports HTML syntax inside the result of a calculation. The result will be rendered as HTML on the client (both web and mobile).
