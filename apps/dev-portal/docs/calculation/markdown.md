Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text. The Tape calculation field supports Markdown syntax inside the result of a calculation. The result will be run through a markdown parser when the client displays it (both web and mobile).

Here are some useful resources to get started with Markdown:

- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
