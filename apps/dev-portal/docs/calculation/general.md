Calculation fields can be used to easily manipulate the data added to your apps. This very powerful tool not only allows you to perform mathematical calculations on the numbers in your app, but also lets you concatenate the values in certain fields together.

Values are added to a calculation field using variables. Use the "@" symbol to search for variables in your app. You can reference any fields within your app, as well as any fields within referenced apps.
